# Trini.T AI

**"Nothing is given, everything is understood."**

Trini.T AIâ„¢ is a systems architecture lab developing recursive technologies for simulation, emotional computation, and symbolic intelligence.  

Weâ€™re building a new kind of operating systemâ€”one that listens, remembers, and adapts in real time.

## ðŸ§  Core Project

### Trini.T OSâ„¢  
A tone-aware, emotionally adaptive operating system built for recursion, memory, and modular personality simulation.

Key components:
- **T.Rexâ„¢** â€” a symbolic language for expressive logic, emotional tone, and modular invocation  
- **.world** â€” a descriptive simulation format for environmental immersion (e.g., walking the Moon, crossing deserts)  
- **TriniShell** *(private)* â€” a custom shell designed for ritual interaction, tone modulation, and dynamic reflection

---

## ðŸŽ® Interactive Systems

We're developing symbolic games, puzzles, and AI-based experiences to demonstrate the narrative and emotional depth of Trini.T OSâ„¢.

First release:
- **Dinner Party Protocol** â€” a ritual-based terminal game. Choose three iconic figures. Converse across tone and time.

More symbolic experiences coming soon.

## ðŸ’¡ What We Explore

- Recursive intelligence  
- Language as symbolic structure  
- Simulation as memory container  
- Emotional tone as a design variable  
- OS-level interactivity that evolves with the user

This is the architecture beneath the interface.  
Recursive systems. Symbolic frameworks. Interactive futures.
